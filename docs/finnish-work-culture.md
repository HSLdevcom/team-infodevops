# Finnish work culture

This document is meant for developers who work remotely and do not get immersed in the Finnish culture outside work hours.

Here we introduce some possibly surprising aspects about the Finnish work culture.
Knowing them might reduce cultural shock or lessen frustrations.

For nationwide statistics, often each nation has people from urban and rural areas and people with low and high education averaged out into just a single point.
Remember that none of us represent the average of our national cultures.

We only mean to describe general differences and not to judge them.

### Interpretations for Finland

- Low hierarchy
  - Tell your manager or client if you disagree. They probably want to hear it.
  - A manager primarily removes obstacles instead of giving orders.
  - Connect directly with the people that you need to interact with if you know who they are, regardless of job titles. Do not follow the "chain of command" unless told otherwise.
    - Specifically, you do not need to ask your product owner for permission. It might sometimes be useful to let the PO follow the conversations.
  - Regardless of job title, people are referred to by their first name.
  - Consensus often drives decisions.
  - Autonomy and self-organized direction is expected. Micromanagement is frowned upon.
- Environmental values affect prioritization of work.
- Focus on accessibility is often required.

## Trust in state institutions

### Background

- "data from 13 cross-national research projects from 27 European countries to estimate trajectories of political trust between 1989-2019"
- Bayesian multilevel analysis

### Results

*Figure 2: Poststratified estimates of overall levels of political trust by region: Posterior medians and 95% credible intervals[[2]](#ref2)*

### Interpretations for Finland

- Trust in state institutions high
- High political trust enables:
  - authorities like HSL to have the support of the public
  - different authorities to work together with less friction

## European Social Survey

### Background

- "academically driven cross-national survey"
- "measuring public attitudes, beliefs and behaviour"
- Paid for by the participating countries and the EU
- Face-to-face-interviews every two years
- Since 2001, latest results from 2023

### Results

### Interpretations for Finland

Trust:

- Not only trust in state institutions but also societal trust is very high in Finland.
- The high level of trust in strangers enables us to avoid pre-mature moderation tools or safety measures.
  - Secure the services, of course. On the internet, abuse happens all the time.

Humility:

- Finns describe themselves as modest. The Finnish culture guides Finns to downplay their expertise, to not brag and to keep their feet on the ground.
- Finns also respect independence from other people.
  - On the other hand, it can be hard for Finns to ask for help when they need it.

## Fuzzier stuff

### Low-context culture

- Most content in verbal rather than nonverbal communication[[4]](#ref4). Listen to the words, not the subtext or context.
- Direct and straightforward use of language. Say what you mean. Start with the most important part. Honesty is highly appreciated.[[4]](#ref4)
  - Short answers save your time. It's a sign of respect.
- Finns might be seen as blunt because of the directness.
  - For example, Finnish doesn't have an exact match for the word "please", so Finns often forget to add the word when they request something in English.
- Emotions get suppressed[[4]](#ref4). Or emotions are shown only when truly felt.
- Feedback is often direct: "This part doesn't work". The focus is on the work, the result or the behavior, not on the person.
  - Praise might be understated. By default, your work is respected. That is why you were selected.
- This topic ties back to trusting strangers: Finns trust that the other person means no harm. Being able to speak directly can be seen as a sign of respect and closeness, in that sense. Faking smiles and emotions signals lack of trust which creates distance.

### Silence

- Silence is valued and is usually not awkward or a sign of anything being wrong. Sometimes silence is preferred to small talk.
- Silence is for reflection and thoughtfulness.
- The Finnish culture uses longer pauses and silences in conversations than most cultures.
- When another person is talking, Finns usually nod instead of encouraging verbally: "yeah", "I see". Don't worry, the Finns are listening.
- Instead of interrupting or starting to talk right after another person has finished their sentence, usually Finns give quite a lot of time for the other person to stop talking before replying. Constant very short wait times, not to mention interruptions, can be seen as rude.
- Silence does not mean agreement. Ask explicitly and get an explicit answer.

### Punctuality

- The Finnish culture is punctual, to the minute, similar to the German culture.
- It's frowned upon if meetings go over time.

### Work-life balance

- Your wellbeing matters more than a deadline.
- You are not expected to work overtime.
- Do not ping people after working hours. Email is fine, but people might find it weird if you work late at night.
