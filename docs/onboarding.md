# Onboarding

This is the starting page for new team members.

## Improvements

It's your responsibility to update this document to fill in the gaps and to add information you wish you had been told.

## Security

**Keep all private information, names and personal contact information, security details or sensitive processes in the Azure DevOps wikis.**

Instead, this repository is public.

We must strike a balance between openness and operational security regarding human processes and social engineering.
Privacy and GDPR has to be taken into account, as well.

## Access to services

Provide the product owner (PO) your work email address and GitHub user name.
The PO will get you started with your accounts and access.
Once you have access, you can read more about it here: <https://dev.azure.com/hslfi/Team%20InfoDevOps/_wiki/wikis/Team-InfoDevOps.wiki/7377/Onboarding>

## Finnish work culture

If you have not worked with Finns before, you might wish to read about the [Finnish work culture](./finnish-work-culture.md) first.

## Public transport domain

You can learn some basics of the [public transport domain](./public-transport-domain.md) on another page.

## First immersion

While we are working on our onboarding documentation, another team has written some great information on their wiki, for example a glossary of public transport terminology in Finnish and English: <https://github.com/HSLdevcom/jore4/wiki/Glossary>
